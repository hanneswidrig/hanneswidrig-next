# React 16.9.x Typescript ESLint Boilerplate

TSLint was deprecated by [Palantir](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) in favor of ESLint. Most of the boilerplate resources that currently exist on GitHub are based on older versions of React or written without Typescript in mind. This repository provides a good starting point for using Typescript and ESLint  as a starting point for your next React project.

## Get Started

I use yarn but it's just as easy to use npm if you prefer.

1. `yarn` or `npm install`
2. `yarn start` or `npm run start`

## Contribute  

I can't promise this will stay updated as React, Typescript, or ESLint are updated. Feel free to create a pull request if you want to add features or update dependencies. I actively watch my GitHub notifications.
